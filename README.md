# Spam-Detection
In my NLP project, I processed a large text corpus using key techniques. 
I started with tokenization and data cleaning for effective text preprocessing. 
Utilizing CountVectorizer, I converted the text into numerical features, capturing word frequencies. 
A Pipeline ensured a streamlined workflow by combining tokenization, data cleaning, and CountVectorizer. 
To understand semantic relationships, I incorporated Word2Vec for word embeddings. For classification, 
I experimented with Multinomial Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. These techniques collectively formed a cohesive NLP solution, enabling me to extract valuable insights from the dataset.
